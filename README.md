# Artificial Neural Network

1. Bank_notes_classification_ANN:
    
    This project uses artificial neural network to classify and predict whether bank notes are authentic or forged
    
  
2. Cancer_Classification_ANN:

    This project uses artificial neural networks to classify whether breast cancer is benign or malignant. Data description is provided in the notebook.
    

3. Geodemographic_Segmentation:

    Artificial Neural Networks are used to carry out a small scale geodemographic segmentation. The network predicts whether a bank customer terminates membership or continues it. Data description is provided in the notebook.
    
    
4.  MNIST_Pytorch:

    Pytorch is used to carry out predictions of handwritten digits from the famous MNIST Dataset. (*all other projects use Keras)
    
    
 4. Titanic_Classification_ANN:
 
    Artificial Neural Networks are used to predict whether a passenger survives or not. This project aims majorly on improving the performance metrics by using neural networks rather than classification machine learing algorithms. Description is provided in the notebook.
